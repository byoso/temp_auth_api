# _quick_auth (v1.0.0)

Complete authentication system ready for a SPA or a classic Django project.

It will use a unique username and only one user can have the same email 'verified' at once.

_quick_auth includes both endpoints and the classic views needed to interact with the auth system (mostly confirmation emails).

Only missing a social authentication...

## Installation

pip install:

```sh
django
PyJWT
# if you need DRF
django-rest-framework
```
Then copy/paste the app `_quick_auth` in your django's root directory.

**settings.py**
```python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    '_quick_auth',
]

# you must have a proper email configuration, for dev let's just say:
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

```
